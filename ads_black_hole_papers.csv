"Intermediate-mass black holes: finding of episodic, large-scale, and powerful jet activity in a dwarf galaxy","Yang, Jun, Paragi, Zsolt, Frey, Sándor, Gurvits, Leonid I., Liao, Mai, Liu, Xiang, Cui, Lang, Yang, Xiaolong, Chen, Wen, Varenius, Eskil, Conway, John E., Chen, Rurong, Chang, Ning",2023,2023MNRAS.520.5964Y,"Dwarf galaxies are characterized by a very low luminosity and low mass. Because of significant accretion and ejection activity of massive black holes, some dwarf galaxies also host low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In a few dwarf AGNs, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations have found faint non-thermal radio emission. SDSS J090613.77+561015.2 is a dwarf AGN owning an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of $M_\mathrm{BH} = 3.6^{+5.9}_{-2.3}\times 10^5 \mathrm{ M}_{\odot }$ and showing a rarely seen two-component radio structure in its radio nucleus. To further probe their nature, i.e. the IMBH jet activity, we performed additional deep observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.66 and 4.99 GHz. We find the more diffuse emission regions and structure details. These new EVN imaging results allow us to reveal a two-sided jet morphology with a size up to about 150 mas (projected length ~140 pc) and a radio luminosity of about 3 × 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The peak feature has an optically thin radio spectrum and thus more likely represents a relatively young ejecta instead of a jet base. The EVN study on SDSS J090613.77+561015.2 demonstrates the existence of episodic, relatively large-scale, and powerful IMBH jet activity in dwarf AGNs. Moreover, we collected a small sample of VLBI-detected dwarf AGNs and investigated their connections with normal AGNs. We notice that these radio sources in the dwarf AGNs tend to have steep spectra and small linear sizes, and possibly represent ejecta from scaled-down episodic jet activity."
Relation between radio core length and black hole mass for active galactic nuclei,"Cao, Xinwu, Jiang, D. R.",2002,2002MNRAS.331..111C,"We explore the relation between the linear length of radio core and the central black hole mass for a sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs). An empirical relation between the size of the broad line region (BLR) and optical luminosity is used to estimate the size of the BLR. The black hole mass is derived from Hβ linewidth and the radius of the BLR on the assumption that the clouds in BLRs are orbiting with Keplerian velocities. A significant intrinsic correlation is found between the linear length of the core and the black hole mass, which implies that the jet formation is closely related with the central black hole. We also find a strong correlation between the black hole mass and the core luminosity."
"A precessing molecular jet signaling an obscured, growing supermassive black hole in NGC 1377?","Aalto, S., Costagliola, F., Muller, S., Sakamoto, K., Gallagher, J. S., Dasyra, K., Wada, K., Combes, F., García-Burillo, S., Kristensen, L. E., Martín, S., van der Werf, P., Evans, A. S., Kotilainen, J.",2016,2016A&A...590A..73A,"With high resolution (0.̋25 × 0.̋18) ALMA CO 3-2 (345 GHz) observations of the nearby (D = 21 Mpc, 1'' = 102 pc), extremely radio-quiet galaxy NGC 1377, we have discovered a high-velocity, very collimated nuclear outflow which we interpret as a molecular jet with a projected length of ±150 pc. The launch region is unresolved and lies inside a radius r&lt; 10 pc. Along the jet axis we find strong velocity reversals where the projected velocity swings from -150km s<SUP>-1</SUP> to +150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A simple model of a molecular jet precessing around an axis close to the plane of the sky can reproduce the observations. The velocity of the outflowing gas is difficult to constrain due to the velocity reversals but we estimate it to be between 240 and 850 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and the jet to precess with a period P = 0.3-1.1 Myr. The CO emission is clumpy along the jet and the total molecular mass in the high-velocity (±(60 to 150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>)) gas lies between 2 × 10<SUP>6</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> (light jet) and 2 × 10<SUP>7</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> (massive jet). There is also CO emission extending along the minor axis of NGC 1377. It holds &gt; 40% of the flux in NGC 1377 and may be a slower, wide-angle molecular outflow which is partially entrained by the molecular jet. We discuss the driving mechanism of the molecular jet and suggest that it is either powered by a (faint) radio jet or by an accretion disk-wind similar to those found towards protostars. It seems unlikely that a massive jet could have been driven out by the current level of nuclear activity which should then have undergone rapid quenching. The light jet would only have expelled 10% of the inner gas and may facilitate nuclear activity instead of suppressing it. The nucleus of NGC 1377 harbours intense embedded activity and we detect emission from vibrationally excited HCN J = 4-3ν<SUB>2</SUB> = 1f which is consistent with hot gas and dust. We find large columns of H<SUB>2</SUB> in the centre of NGC 1377 which may be a sign of a high rate of recent gas infall. The dynamical age ofthe molecular jet is short (&lt;1 Myr), which could imply that it is young and consistent with the notion that NGC 1377 is caught in a transient phase of its evolution. However, further studies are required to determine the age of the molecular jet, its mass and the role it is playing in the growth of the nucleus of NGC 1377. <P />Based on observations carried out with the ALMA Interferometer.

The impact of Faraday effects on polarized black hole images of Sagittarius A*,"Jiménez-Rosales, Alejandra, Dexter, Jason",2018,2018MNRAS.478.1875J,"We study model images and polarization maps of Sagittarius A* at 230 GHz. We post-process general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and perform a fully relativistic radiative transfer calculation of the emitted synchrotron radiation to obtain polarized images for a range of mass accretion rates and electron temperatures. At low-accretion rates, the polarization map traces the underlying toroidal magnetic field geometry. At high-accretion rates, we find that Faraday rotation internal to the emission region can depolarize and scramble the map. We measure the net linear polarization fraction and find that high-accretion rate `jet-disc' models are heavily depolarized and are therefore disfavoured. We show how Event Horizon Telescope measurements of the polarized `correlation length' over the image provide a model independent upper limit on the strength of these Faraday effects, and constrain plasma properties like the electron temperature and magnetic field strength."
SS 433 : a black hole candidate ?,"Zwitter, Tomaz, Calvani, Massimo",1989,1989MNRAS.236..581Z,"The limits on the masses and dimensions of the components of the SS433 binary system derived by Stewart et al. (1987) are improved using an improved Roche lobe geometry. The new limits account for the fact that the accretion disk in the system may occupy a considerable fraction of the Roche lobe component. Using X-ray and optical observations, it is found that the mass of the object is about 10 solar masses, while the length of the X-ray jet is about 1.4 X 10 to the 12th cm."
AU-Scale Synchrotron Jets and Superluminal Ejecta in GRS 1915+105,"Dhawan, V., Mirabel, I. F., Rodríguez, L. F.",2000,2000ApJ...543..373D,"Radio imaging of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) over a range of wavelengths (13, 3.6, 2.0, and 0.7 cm), in different states of the black hole binary, always resolves the nucleus as a compact jet of length ~10λ<SUB>cm</SUB> AU. The nucleus is best imaged at the shorter wavelengths, on scales of 2.5-7 AU (0.2-0.6 mas resolution). The brightness temperature of the core is T<SUB>B</SUB>&gt;=10<SUP>9</SUP> K, and its properties are better fitted by a conically expanding synchrotron jet model rather than a thermal jet. The nuclear jet varies in ~30 minutes during minor X-ray/radio outbursts and reestablishes within ~18 hr of a major outburst, indicating the robustness of the X-ray/radio (or disk/jet) system to disruption. At lower resolution (80-240 AU), more extended ejecta are imaged at ~500 AU separation from the stationary core. Time-lapse images clearly detect the superluminal motion of the ejecta in a few hours. The measured velocity is 1.5c+/-0.1c (D/12 kpc) for the approaching component and is consistent with ballistic motion of the ejecta from 500 AU outward, perhaps even since birth. The axis of the ejecta differs by &lt;=12° clockwise from the axis of the AU-scale jet, measured in the same observation. Both axes are stable in time (+/-5°), the AU scale for 2 yr and the large scale for over 4 yr. Astrometry over 2 yr relative to an extragalactic reference locates the black hole to +/-1.5 mas, and its secular parallax due to Galactic rotation is 5.8+/-1.5 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with a distance of 12 kpc. Finally, a limit of &lt;=100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> is placed on its proper motion with respect to its neighborhood. Some accreting black holes of stellar mass (e.g., Cyg X-1, 1E 1740-2942, GRS 1758-258, GX 339-4) and supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies (e.g., Sgr A<SUP>*</SUP>) lack evidence of large flares and discrete transient ejecta but have compact radio cores with steady, flat-spectrum ``plateau'' states, like GRS 1915+105. To the present day GRS 1915+105 is the only system where both AU-scale steady jets and large-scale superluminal ejections have been unambiguously observed. Our observations suggest that the unresolved flat-spectrum radio cores of accreting black holes are compact quasi-continuous synchrotron jets."
Supermassive Black Holes: An Exploration of Galactic Nuclei and Jets via Radio Emission Analysis,"Grover, Ambika, Pinto, Sarah, Raut, Siddhi, Sella Kapu, Malithi, Porandla, Rishika, Ries, Judit G.",2022,2022AGUFMED42B0566G,"The role of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies has been an increasingly exciting area in the realm of astronomical research. SMBHs are often millions and billions times the mass of our sun with a gravitational pull proportional to its mass, able to trap light itself. In this research, we pursued a project using radio sources from the Radio Galaxy Zoo: LOFAR software, which are emitted by jets from SMBHs. Whenever possible, we also tried to connect these jets with the host galaxy of the SMBH. Through classifying 1000 radio sources, we identified the visible galaxies for 110 of them. For galaxies that more than one individual classified, we compared the results of our analysis to yield a 90.7% consistency rate. This rate was 15 times better than the rate at which the project's AI could connect the components, a promising indication of the efficacy and importance of citizen science. Moving further than the citizen science project required, we decided to investigate the relationship between the galactic nuclei's radii and the jets' breadth. In doing so, we hoped to establish a potential correlation between jets-beams of matter expelled from the black hole-and the size of the galaxy they arise from. To complete this analysis, we used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and overlaid the images provided by the Radio Galaxy Zoo project with the Sloan images. Having the same scale allowed us to compare the jets' relative size to the galaxy's size. From this, we calculated the ratio between the jet's length and the galaxy's size. We used the size of the galaxy as a proxy for its brightness, as neither SDSS nor the Radio Galaxy Zoo provided this information. We found that as the radius of an optical source increases, the average length of the jets increases. When there was only one distinguishable jet, we used the information on the singular jet length for the relationship."
The discovery of a radio galaxy of at least 5 Mpc,"Oei, Martijn S. S. L., van Weeren, Reinout J., Hardcastle, Martin J., Botteon, Andrea, Shimwell, Tim W., Dabhade, Pratik, Gast, Aivin R. D. J. G. I. B., Röttgering, Huub J. A., Brüggen, Marcus, Tasse, Cyril, Williams, Wendy L., Shulevski, Aleksandar",2022,2022A&A...660A...2O,"Context. Giant radio galaxies (GRGs, or colloquially `giants') are the Universe's largest structures generated by individual galaxies. They comprise synchrotron-radiating active galactic nucleus ejecta and attain cosmological (megaparsec-scale) lengths. However, the main mechanisms that drive their exceptional growth remain poorly understood. <BR /> Aims: To deduce the main mechanisms that drive a phenomenon, it is usually instructive to study extreme examples. If there exist host galaxy characteristics that are an important cause for GRG growth, then the hosts of the largest GRGs are likely to possess them. Similarly, if there exist particular large-scale environments that are highly conducive to GRG growth, then the largest GRGs are likely to reside in them. For these reasons, we aim to perform a case study of the largest GRG available. <BR /> Methods: We reprocessed the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey DR2 by subtracting compact sources and performing multi-scale CLEAN de-convolutions at 60″ and 90″ resolution. The resulting images constitute the most sensitive survey yet for radio galaxy lobes, whose diffuse nature and steep synchrotron spectra have allowed them to evade previous detection attempts at higher resolution and shorter wavelengths. We visually searched these images for GRGs. <BR /> Results: We have discovered Alcyoneus, a low-excitation radio galaxy with a projected proper length l<SUB>p</SUB> = 4.99 ± 0.04 Mpc. Both its jets and lobes are detected at very high significance, and the SDSS-based identification of the host, at spectroscopic redshift z<SUB>spec</SUB> = 0.24674 ± 6 × 10<SUP>−5</SUP>, is unambiguous. The total luminosity density at ν = 144 MHz is L<SUB>ν</SUB> = 8 ± 1 × 10<SUP>25</SUP> W Hz<SUP>−1</SUP>, which is below average, though near median (percentile 45 ± 3%) for GRGs. The host is an elliptical galaxy with a stellar mass M<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 2.4 ± 0.4 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a super-massive black hole mass M<SUB>•</SUB> = 4 ± 2 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, both of which tend towards the lower end of their respective GRG distributions (percentiles 25 ± 9% and 23 ± 11%). The host resides in a filament of the Cosmic Web. Through a new Bayesian model for radio galaxy lobes in three dimensions, we estimate the pressures in the megaparsec-cubed-scale northern and southern lobes to be P<SUB>min, 1</SUB> = 4.8 ± 0.3 × 10<SUP>−16</SUP> Pa and P<SUB>min, 2</SUB> = 4.9 ± 0.6 × 10<SUP>−16</SUP> Pa, respectively. The corresponding magnetic field strengths are B<SUB>min, 1</SUB> = 46 ± 1 pT and B<SUB>min, 2</SUB> = 46 ± 3 pT. <BR /> Conclusions: We have discovered what is in projection the largest known structure made by a single galaxy - a GRG with a projected proper length l<SUB>p</SUB> = 4.99 ± 0.04 Mpc. The true proper length is at least l<SUB>min</SUB> = 5.04 ± 0.05 Mpc. Beyond geometry, Alcyoneus and its host are suspiciously ordinary: the total low-frequency luminosity density, stellar mass, and super-massive black hole mass are all lower than, though similar to, those of the medial GRG. Thus, very massive galaxies or central black holes are not necessary to grow large giants, and, if the observed state is representative of the source over its lifetime, neither is high radio power. A low-density environment remains a possible explanation. The source resides in a filament of the Cosmic Web, with which it might have significant thermodynamic interaction. The pressures in the lobes are the lowest hitherto found, and Alcyoneus therefore represents the most promising radio galaxy yet to probe the warm-hot inter-galactic medium."
Active galactic nuclei jet mass loading and truncation by stellar winds,"Hubbard, A., Blackman, E. G.",2006,2006MNRAS.371.1717H,"Active galactic nuclei can produce extremely powerful jets. While tightly collimated, the scale of these jets and the stellar density at galactic centres implies that there will be many jet/star interactions, which can mass load the jet through stellar winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by a small number of high mass-loss stars. We construct a framework for jet mass loading by stellar winds for a broader spectrum of wind mass-loss rates than has previously been considered. Given the observed stellar mass distributions in galactic centres, we find that even highly efficient (0.1 Eddington luminosity) jets from supermassive black holes of masses M<SUB>BH</SUB> &lt;~ 10<SUP>4</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> are rapidly mass loaded and quenched by stellar winds. For 10<SUP>4</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> &lt; M<SUB>BH</SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>8</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, the quenching length of highly efficient jets is independent of the jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind mass loading is unable to quench efficient jets from more massive engines, but can account for the observed truncation of the inefficient M87 jet, and implies a baryon-dominated composition on scales &gt;~2 kpc therein even if the jet is initially pair plasma dominated."
"Luminosity distribution in the central regions of Messier 87: isothermal core, point source, or black hole?","de Vaucouleurs, G., Nieto, J. -L.",1979,1979ApJ...230..697D,"A combination of photographic and photoelectric photometry with the McDonald 2 m reflector is used to derive a precise mean luminosity profile (r *) of M87 (jet excluded) at 0""6 resolution out to r * = 70"". Within 8"" from the center the luminosity is less than predicted by extrapolation of the r11 law defined by the main body of the galaxy (8"" &lt; r * &lt; 240""), but is in excess of an isothermal core model best fitted in the interval 6"" &lt; r * &lt; 20"". This central spike cannot be explained simply by adding a nonthermal point source to an isothermal core model, or by adding only a central point mass (black hole?). It is well represented by the sum of a modified isothermal core model having both a central point mass and a central point source. At a revised distance A = 12.6 Mpc ( o = 30.5) the structural length ofthe underlying isothermal is a = 2""78 = 170 pc, the mass of the ""black hole"" = 1.7. 10 and the luminosity of the point source (B0 = 16.95, M0 = - 13.55) equals 4.2% of the integrated luminosity B(6"") = 13.52 of the galaxy within r * = 6"". These results agree closely with and confirm the work of the Hale team. Comparison of the McDonald and Hale data suggests that the central source may have been slightly brighter ( 0.5 mag) in 1964 than in 1975-1977.
